Syllabus
Welcome to Advanced Styling with Responsive Design, taught by Colleen van Lent!
This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of creating responsive websites.
What is a responsive site? The easiest answer may be to describe sites that aren't responsive. Have you ever visited a site on your phone and the content just seems crammed in? You maybe get the idea that the site was designed for a large screen and simply shrunk down for the phone. Or even worse, it wasn't shrunk at all and you have to do a lot of side-to-side scrolling? Or maybe you have been on a website on your tablet, but a bunch of key components are locked and you are forced to go back when you have access to a laptop or desktop? 
The following are examples of sites that do not use responsive design;
 
 
 
 
 
This course is meant for people who are comfortable using HTML and CSS, but want to take the first steps to creating a single site that can display a different layout (or "look") on different platforms.
There are three common approaches to responsive design. 
•	The first is to create your own site using fluid measurements and media queries. 
•	The second is to use an existing framework (such as Bootstrap) that does all of the responsive design for you.
•	The third is to use a hybrid approach - use a framework in combination with your own responsive code.
Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the importance of good habits and examples of potential pitfalls. All of the example code is provided to you as a starting place. For some learners, this will be sufficient to get a decent base on how responsive design works. For other learners however, there is nothing better than when they decide they can write better versions of the code.
Resources
Course Site
All of the reading material you will need to pass this course is contained within Coursera. 
Additional resources may be added as optional material, but everything will be online and free.
CodePEN
For the coding content you may want to access my CodePEN account. CodePEN is a website that allows you to modify copies of my code. In real time you can see how your changes affect the website we are working on. The one issue that some students have with CodePEN is that it doesn't require you to link your files together. So, if you want to write the code right on your machine, you will need to know how to link the code. Don't worry, I do cover that in class.
Here is a link to a collection of code for each week of the course:
Week One: http://codepen.io/collection/nmyRWM/
Week Two: http://codepen.io/collection/nYwVkZ/
Week Three: http://codepen.io/collection/DZQyBr/
Week Four: http://codepen.io/collection/XkkwBb/
When you watch the videos, you can check the resources section to find a link to any code that is used in the lectures. 
On each video page, just below the video, there is a Downloads section on the right-hand side of the screen. This contains links to mp3 downloads of videos, transcripts and any CodePEN files referenced in that particular video. Oftentimes you will see two files, a "starter" file and a "complete" file. This way you can start at the same place as me, but still have access to the final product.
Discussion Boards
The best way to get help is to utilize the discussion boards. I know that this may be new to many of you so let me explain how the discussion boards work. We always have one friendly "where are you from? /introduce" yourself board where people tend to be social. Other than that, we encourage people to use the discussion section that goes with the week you are on. Notice that I said "use" not "post." We really want to encourage you to read before you post. You will often find your question already there. If you don't find your question, make sure to post. There are no "stupid" questions. Ever. (Sometimes you may just have found a mistake on my part that I will need to fix.)
Course Slides
The slides for all of the lectures are now posted. You can find a BIG zip file at http://intro-webdesign.com/ResponsiveDesignSlides.zip that has a pdf and powerpoint copy of all of the slides.
I have also attached the pdf and powerpoint slide for each lecture directly in the videos themselves. Just look in the Downloads section to view them.
 

 

00. Introduction to Responsive Design
 
Hi everybody, I'm Colleen van Lent and I'd like to welcome you to introduction to responsive design. In this course, we're going to talk about different ways that you can make your website look the best it can possibly look. No matter if someone's viewing them on a phone, a laptop or a tablet. 
We're really going to cover the basics in this course and help you develop a general understanding of what responsive design is and why you need to know it. We're going to talk about ways that you can customize your own site without using any special software to give it a really special look and feel. 
However, we also want to talk about using frameworks. 
Because if other people are using software or different code to make their site look great, why not take advantage of it and learn how to use it yourself. 
 
In week one, we're really going to focus on the theory. 
The idea of what is responsive design. 
What do people mean when they use that term? 
Those of us in technology are pretty guilty of throwing out terms and using them even when we don't really know what they mean. 
We're going to talk about what makes for good responsive design. 
If you don't know what to aim for, it's really hard to know how to get started. 
Finally, we're going to end the week talking about something very concrete and that's the role of what we call fluid measurements; these different type of measurements that can change as the screen size changes.
 
In week two we're going to tackle media queries. 
And this is the first time you're really going to get your hands really dirty with some code, and get things to work. 
We're going to talk about what they are. 
And how do you plan, before you even start to code, for the best practice? 
It doesn't really do you any good to sit down and code without having a plan. 
In week two, we're going to talk about break points, how you can decide what different screen sizes are the ones you really want to focus on. 
And finally, I am going to do an example where you and I are going to code together to make a navigation bar.
By the end of week two, you're going to be ready and feel like you can really tackle this. 
 
In week three, we're going to shift a little bit and instead of writing our own code.
We're going to start using different frameworks.
In particular, we're going to talk about the different benefits and pitfalls of using other people's code.
Sometimes, it's really easy and really great to be able to use these different software options. 
But sometimes it comes at the cost of good practice and accessibility. 
In particular we're going to talk about the Bootstrap 3 framework. 
I've picked this one because it's one of the most popular frameworks out there. 
Now for those of you who may be familiar with responsive design you'll know that a Bootstrap 4 is coming out soon. 
But that's okay. I'm going to focus on those elements of Bootstrap 3 that you're going to be able to use over and over again. 
The simple things such as getting started, the grid system, and also, also again, a navigation bar. 
Because these are the keys to really getting your site to have that responsive feel. 
 
Finally, in week four, we're going to continue with more bootstrap, but we're going to talk about things such as images, tables, and maybe some advanced navigation techniques. 
These are things that are cool and kind of fun, but I don't really think are core to understanding what responsive design is. 
So, we leave them at the end to make them something more we can play around with. We're also, I'm hoping to get to some case studies. We're going to talk to people about how they approached designing the responsiveness their real-life sites.
 
We will do this with the culmination of a final project. 
When you're done with this course, you are going to have one or more pages that you have written yourself. 
With the help of a framework that can respond to different screen sizes.
So, who is this class designed for?  It's really someone who's new to responsive design.  Someone who'd like to get started and possibly carry on these ideas once their done with the course. 
You will need a general knowledge of HTML and CSS in order to get the most out of this course.  If you don't understand those two concepts, I recommend you go back and get a grasp of them and then come back to us in the responsive class. 
Again, as with any coding class at all.  This is a class with people with persistence. You're going to run into problems.  This isn't a course where you're going to read something, take a quiz and you're done. Instead, we're going to be coding, probably failing a little bit, coding, failing some more, then and then hopefully success. 
So, who am I? Well, if you're new to one of my courses, I have a PHD in computer science. I've been teaching for about two decades, sticking mostly with introductory programming, web design, and artificial intelligence. What I really love to do is help students debug. Help them to get those general basic ideas down so they can go off and really master some of the more advanced concepts. 
And I understand that it's not always about conveying content.  It's about helping you recognize those places where you might run into trouble. If I can let you know early, it might help you get up over some of those humps. 
So, in this course, we're going to have a pretty consistent workload. Every week, you'll have multiple videos to watch.  Some of them will be kind of traditional lecture format. However, there will be other which I tend to call, “Code With Me”. These are lectures where I really hope you'll sit down and type along with me and make sure you can replicate what I'm doing. 
There will be a few weekly readings but there'll always be online articles. I like to find things that are very pertinent to what's going on in web design right now. 
So how do you succeed in this class? 
 
I will always say that the best way to code is with a friend but that's not always possible, so I hope that you'll use the message boards not only to ask your questions but to answer the questions of others. 
Never spend more than 20 minutes on something that doesn't work.  I'm not kidding. I want you to just move on.  When things are working it's great, you can whip out a whole bunch of code.  But when it's not it's rarely the case that staring at it is going to make it any better. 
Make sure that you feel comfortable looking things up on your own.  This is the internet; you can stick your question into a search engine and you will probably find the answer. 
You'll find three or four wrong answers, but eventually, the answer will be there. 
 
Finally, make sure that you practice, practice, practice. The only way to really learn how to code is to make sure you're getting as much experience as you can. 
Welcome to introduction to responsive web design.  I hope that you'll learn a lot. Thanks.
01. What is Responsive Design?
Hi, everybody, so you're here and I'm here, and we're here to talk about responsive design.
But one of the first questions should be, what is responsive web design?
And what it is, is it's designing your web site with the idea that people will be viewing it from multiple screen sizes and different resolutions as well.
So, we want to make sure that our side is going to, what we call work, under any platform, any browser size or any orientation. 
And by orientation, I mean whether you turn your phone up or to the side.
And same for the tablet. 
The most important lesson is that you want to make sure that the user has the power.
Don't dictate to them what they can and can't do.
Let me give you an example.
A lot of times when you're looking at a site on a smaller screen such as your phone you get a lot less content.
And while it's true their smaller space it's not that there should be less things you can do everything should just be laid out a little bit more intelligently.
You have to remember that people are doing more and more things on their phone that they've never done before.
We often think now about watching videos, but we also have to think about filling out applications, or coding.
There's going to be a lot of things that we don't even know yet that exist, so we want to be as flexible as possible. 
The most important thing is, never assume that the user won't need access to specific functionality.
I think we've all been there when we're looking at a website on a smaller device and we just can't find the thing that we're looking for.
Or even worse, there's these pictures or buttons or different things we can't even move them out of the way with our fingers because the site just won't work for us.
So here are some of the concepts that we're going to be considering throughout this entire course. 
 
Three concepts that I want you to keep in the back of your mind.
And I'm hoping at the end of this course you'll be able to say, yeah I think I've got that, and the first one is called media queries, and what media queries do is that they can detect the view port size and other information about the device that the browser is on.
The next thing that we're going to want to talk about is this idea of flexible grid-based layout for relative sizing.
And relative means, depending on how large the screen is, that's how big your grid is going to be as well. 
And, finally we want to think about flexible images.
All these things add up, so that when you go to the page, the user doesn't need to waste their time scrolling back and forth or trying to resize things to be able to see everything. 
We want it to happen really automatically.
 
Let's take a look at some examples that have great responsive design. 
The first place I'm going to take you is a website called mediaqueri.es. 
This site has a really nice collection of different sites that it's found that really kind of find that key to responsive design. 
Let's go ahead and take a look at, I'll scroll down a few. How about this one right here? CapRadio, go anyplace. 
This site right now, when I'm looking at the large screen, you can see that there's a definite look to the layout.
As I resize the screen, as if I'm looking perhaps on a tablet, and I reload it you can see that things have moved over. 
The navigation bar is now over to the left when it wasn't there before.
I'm going to go ahead and make it smaller still. I don't even need to refresh. 
And now you might see something that looks much closer.
To that look and feel of something you would see on the phone. The navigation bar has completely disappeared, and there's this little pop up and down.
These different sites just don't make everything smaller, let me make it bigger, they actually think about the best way to lay out the content, so that you can still find everything that's there without having to look too much.
Now, you can use that site to see examples of great responsive design, but what if I also wanted to show you an example of kind of bad responsible design. 
Unfortunately, when you Google that out, or you look for that on your search engine, nobody really wants to advertise the fact that they're really bad at web design so I found one for you. 
It's the Internal Revenue Service.
And what we have here is a site that not only looks the same, but is laid out the same no matter what type of screen you're looking at.
It looks okay right here, but when I make the screen much smaller, you can see that it didn't really do anything.
Now I actually have to physically scroll back and forth to see things.
The navigation bar hasn't changed. You have the same size pictures. 
This is just an example of really bad responsive design.
Let's work together over the next few weeks to make sure that you are avoiding those same types of traps, and we're going to get started coding right away.
02. Testing Existing Sites
Hi, everybody. One of the things that you're going to want to do is test your site to see how it's doing across multiple devices and multiple view ports.
But unless you happen to just be flux with money, you may not have access to all these different types of platforms.
What can you do? Well, one option if you're using a desktop or a laptop, that you can resize your window and refresh the site. 

So, if I go here; <https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ibm-web-dev.bauska.org>  The Introduction to Wed Design for everybody, of course. I can just use my mouse and resize it, take a look and see how things are going to change. Here, large view, tablet and mobile view. So, I can see that I have three different break points that all work. That works great if you're on a laptop or some sort of desktop, but what if you're on a mobile device? 
It isn't simple or even often possible to resize that window, so we need to come up with another solution that will help you out. 
What you can do is look for online tools to help you check for your responsiveness. One that you may want to look at is called ami.responsivedesign.is. https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ibm-web-dev.bauska.org I'm going to go through and I'm going to show you three different sites and how we can use this website to test the responsiveness of these webpages. Here we go.
 
Here's a website that you can go to. Down at the bottom of the screen, you can fill in the URL of the site you want to look at. 
 
Just so you know, this is made with an HTML tag that makes it so that you have to put in a URL. It's always going to be looking for at least that www. So, let's go ahead and look at that Intro to Web Design website again. 

There we go. Now if you look up at the top of the screen you can see that my website is now displayed on four different platforms. I have the desktop, the laptop, a tablet view and a mobile view, and you can see that each one is a little bit different depending upon the platform I'm using. 
Let's check out another site. 
 
In this case, again we can see that this is a responsive setup. Now, even though the pages may look very similar, you can see that on the mobile view that weather map isn't there, that kind of brightly colored map. 
In addition, the laptop and desktop view are very similar. But you can see that in the tablet view, we've really broken it down and they use more of a two-column grid system rather than having quite as much content. 

The next site I'm going to check is one that I've made from my umich site. Going here, paste in that URL, and we can take a look. What I've tried to do here is to have a little bit more distinct look, so that you can see that I've tried to develop my site for really what the people might want to be using. So, in my larger view I've got my picture, because you know, everybody wants to see me. I've got my name and then my contact information. On the laptop view it's very similar. In the tablet, I've kind of just reduced the space. That information is still important, but I don't need so much space in between them. In my phone viewer, mobile view though, I've gotten rid of the picture and I've started to stack the information to make it easier for people to see. I'm able to look at all four of these views on a single website, and this makes it much easier than trying to go back and forth and resize my window. However, there is the caveat that this site doesn't always work for every different website. It may be the case that people aren't using traditional responsive web design. So, on this site, the pages all look the same. But if you were actually viewing them on a browser, they would look different. The next option you can try is to use tools on your Chrome or Firefox, or whatever browser you're using. It's often the case that your browser is going to have special tools that let you simulate looking at things from different viewpoints. With Chrome, you can use inspect element to see the different viewpoints in realtime. Let's take a look. So, I've gone here to my website looking at it in chrome and pretty much enlarge screen view. I'm going to drag it out a little bit here. You can see i've got my large screen I've got a lot of spacing in it. So, I'm going to go in and do inspect element by right clicking Click over here. And what I can do now is up in the upper left-hand corner, there's something that looks like a small little mobile phone. It says Toggle device mode. I'm going to click on that. And when I do, I am now viewing my site as if I'm viewing it on a small mobile phone. Depending upon your operating system in the browser of the addition that you have, you can go up to the device in the upper left-hand corner select mode, or model actually. And say what would it look like on an iPhone 6? It is a little bit bigger, what if I look at it on a google nexus seven. Same thing. So, you can pick a number of different options to kind of see what the site would look like. Let's see, do one last one, a laptop. Depending on which type of platform people are using. So now that you know some quick and easy ways to review the responsiveness of existing sites, it's a really good idea for you to go out and get that feel for what you think looks really good, or sometimes even more importantly, what you think you want to avoid on your site. Go ahead and have some fun and mock your friends if their sites aren't responsive. Don't worry, yours will be.
Benefits of Responsive Design
Hi everybody. Today, let's talk about some of the benefits of responsive design. First thing we need to realize is that responsive design means different things to different people. We're going to talk about three different options that people often use, and why the responsive web design that we're going to adopt has its true benefits. The first option, responsive web design or RWD, is really dealing with fluid measurements, flexible grids, and varying CSS rules. We also have adaptive design, or what's sometimes called dynamic serving. What happens here is that you can end up returning different versions of a page based on the type of device being used. The third type is the separate mobile site, or .m. This is when you create a completely separate page URL for the mobile site. First, let's talk about responsive web design. With the definition that we're using, the test really is, are you getting back the same code regardless of the device that you're using? You know that I'm a big fan of inspect element and viewing the source code, so my question is, are you going to get the same source code no matter what platform you're looking at? Now, as humans we can do that by viewing the source code or other little tricks. But sometimes when you're thinking about things such as source engine optimization and getting really high rankings on your page. A bot can also tell if you're using responsive web design by looking for certain meta tag named viewport. It can be detected automatically and would really, kind of help boost your search engine score, is what many people think. The second type, adaptive design, means that the server figures out what kind of device you're running on and then returns specific HTML and
CSS for that page. So, you can get completely different code depending upon what device you're using. With responsive web design, it's the same code, just different styling. Here, you're getting different content, the important thing you realize is that no matter where you're doing it from, you're using the same URL. Now, there's a few issues with this, in that the server might return the wrong code if the wrong device type is detected. That third option of having a dedicated mobile site, or a .m URL, means that you're going to get a different page completely on a completely different URL when you're using this approach. it's incredibly popular and you're going to see it very often. When you're on a site, check and see if you have .m in front of your normal URL, or sometimes even a little bit different URL depending upon your device. It's possible if you're going to take this design step to link the fact that pages are related by including a link tag and using the relationships canonical and alternate. Which means, you know what? This is my main page but I do have some alternate URLs out there. Why would you bother doing this? 
Again, it's for search engine optimization. It really helps if the search engines can know that this is the same type of information just on different URLs. So why am I stressing responsive web design? Well, number one, it's a lot easier to share your data if you only have a single URL. You don't want to have to have multiple versions to hand out to people if they want to access your site. It's also easier for search engines such as Google to index the page or kind of mark it to know that it seen it before and would like to rank it. The number one reason, again, is that fewer files means less maintenance. If you have different HTML code for different platforms, if you change one, that's not maintaining all of them. You have to go in and update every single file. And another reason, is that if you have a single place that you're going a single URL, then you're going to have less redirection. Redirection is when you go to a site, and you see that the URL is being changed as the server tries to figure out what type of device you're using and what kind of page or URL you should be redirected to. Lower load time is always great. Hopefully you see why responsive design is really important. It may even be obvious to you because you're really into this topic. However, if you're ever working a project, you may need to convince someone that they need to pay you for that extra time to make sure their site is responsive. And in that case, hopefully, you've learned some facts here that can help convince other people how important responsive web design really is.
